## New features

### Interactive web page (controlled by a chatbot:

Interactive or controlled website is a trend that has emerged after a popularization of virtual assistants in recent years. Basically it's having a virtual assistant (Chatbot) available on the site and that has the ability to perform actions independently without customer action, just based on the understanding of the user's questions and answers.

An interactive webpage was developed through the virtual assistant. Basically, there are two scenarios in which were considered as a **_simple conversation_** and an **_advanced conversation_**.

**Simple Conversation**: the simple conversion represents interactions in which the chatbot responds to the user with only texts, as shown in the image below:

**Advanced conversation**: the advanced conversion when a virtual assistant identifies that it will be necessary to perform a command in the web application to meet the user's request, as shown in the image below:

### Virtual assistant (multilingual in English and French):

The virtual assistant was built using IBM's Watson Assistant as a natural language processing engine. All knowledge, training and conversation flow developed in Watson Assistant is available at this link.
